// The following function Loader and interfaces Data and Instance work together
// as an abstraction to support language specific eBPF unwinding and host agent side symbolization
// of frames.
//
// Functionality for these interfaces is divided as follows:
//
//  1. Loader is responsible for recognizing if the given mapping/ELF DSO matches by name,
//     and later by content, to an interpreter supported by the specific implementation.
//     If yes, it returns Data for this specific DSO. The Loader loads and checks data
//     from given ELF DSO. The intent is to load needed symbols and keep their addresses
//     relative to the file virtual address space. It can also load static data from the
//     DSO, such as the exact interpreter version string or number. All this is returned
//     in a data structure that implements Data interface.
//
//  2. Data is the interface to operate on per-ELF DSO data. ProcessManager receives this
//     interface from the Loader, and stores it in a map to cache them by FileID. That is,
//     each ELF DSO is probed by the Loaders only the first time it is seen. The returned
//     Data is then reused for all other processes using the same ELF DSO without need to
//     extract information from it by the loader.
//
//     The Attach method will populate the needed eBPF maps with the pre-parsed data from
//     the Data and PID specific AttachData. E.g. it can calculate the target memory addresses
//     by adding the file virtual address from cached Data and the process AttachData mapping
//     "bias". If additional per-PID structures need to be maintained it can instantiate new
//     Instance structures for those. Finally an Instance interface is returned: either to
//     the per-PID Instance structure, or if no per-PID data is kept, the main Data structure
//     can also implement this interface.
//
//  3. Instance is the interface to operate on per-PID data. This interface
//     is tracked by the ProcessManager by PID and the mapped-at-address.
//
//     The ProcessManager will delegate frame symbolization to this interface,
//     and it will also call this interface's Detach to clean up eBPF maps release any
//     per-PID resource held.
//
// The split of Data and Instance and the way the methods signatures are designed (passing ebpfMaps
// and pid) allows an interpreter implementation to keep just per-ELF information (when the xxxData
// implements both interfaces) or additionally track per-PID information (separate data types for
// the Data and Instance).
//
// Data (and Instance) should generally match one eBPF tracer implementation. However, it is
// possible to have several Loaders that would return same type of Data. For example,
// xxInterpreter 2 and xxInterpreter 3 can likely be unwound by the same unwinding strategy but
// perhaps the symbol names or the way to extract introspection data is different. Or perhaps we
// need to hard code different well known offsets in the xxData. It allows then to still
// share the Data and Instance code between these versions.
