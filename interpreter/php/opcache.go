// PHP8+ JIT compiler unwinder.
// This file contains the code necessary for unwinding PHP code that has been JIT compiled.
//
// TL;DR: This file exists just to provide the PHP unwinder with the right PIDPages for JIT'd code.
// Everything else in interpreterphp works as expected for unwinding this code.
//
// It turns out that the PHP JIT compiler is a little bit strange compared to other JIT compilers
// (e.g V8) because of the unique limitations of the PHP compiler (or, rather, over 20 years of
// organic code growth).
//
// If you want to understand how the PHP JIT compiler actually works, there's no substitute
// for reading the PHP source code documents. In particular, these are useful:
//
// 1) https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-8.0/ext/opcache/jit/zend_jit.h
// 2) https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-8.0/ext/opcache/jit/zend_jit.c (if you have a while)
//
// It might also be useful to know how Zend Extensions work (or, at least be aware of their existence)
// It turns out the way these have been structured implies almost everything you need to know about
// why the JIT compiler is the way it is. This is a useful resource for understanding them
// https://www.phpinternalsbook.com/php7/extensions_design/zend_extensions.html
//
// The PHP JIT compiler uses dynasm for the actual JITing portion of the code. The informal
// tutorial is really good, you should read it (https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/tutorial.html)
// You don't need to understand how Dynasm actually works for understanding this code, but it
// still might be useful for other projects.
//
// Before we begin it's illustrative to understand how PHP works internally.
// PHP belongs to the class of interpreted languages that use bytecode: each PHP function is
// decomposed into a sequence of bytecode instructions that are then executed by the PHP interpreter.
// These instructions are known as zend_ops in the Zend compiler, and their internal structure
// looks like this:
//  struct _zend_op {
//     const void *handler;
//     znode_op op1;
//     znode_op op2;
//     znode_op result;
//     ....
//  };
//
// Here the "handler" member is a pointer to some function that is executed when the
// zend_op is evaluated. Typically this is a PHP function of some kind that has already been
// pre-built.  You can imagine this as a function pointer to some function that
// accepts two arguments and produces a singular result. Note that znode_ops can refer to other _zend_ops,
// which allows you to build a AST.
// A good resource on this (with far more detail, if you need it) is
// https://www.npopov.com/2017/04/14/PHP-7-Virtual-machine.html
//
// The way that the JIT compiler works is that it replaces the handler pointer with the address
// of some JIT'd code.
// In other words, there's some code somewhere that does something like this:
//              my_op->handler = &some_function;
// (Or, exactly, this: https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-8.0/ext/opcache/jit/zend_jit.c#L427)
// This means that when the zend_op is evaluated native code is used
// rather than the PHP function, which enables the code to be much faster.
//
// The implication of this is that the PHP unwinder doesn't actually need to be changed at all (beyond a few offsets)
// since the executor_globals is still the primary point of execution[1]. This means that all we have to do
// is tell the eBPF code to unwind PHP when JIT'd code is encountered.
//
// However, getting the JIT memory regions inside the base PHP interpreter is difficult.
// It turns out that PHP's JIT compiler is a bit strange: the memory for the JIT'd code lives inside a
// Zend extension called the OPCache.
//
// As justification: older versions of PHP (e.g before PHP 5.5) had a problem: each time a script was executed
// the script needed to be parsed into opcodes, compiled on the virtual machine and then
// executed. This is rather inefficient for frequently called scripts: so, PHP 5.5 introduced
// the OPcache, which caches frequently used scripts and the corresponding opcodes.
// It turns out that the makers of the Zend engine reasoned that if you wanted the JIT you'd also want the Opcache.
//
// It's natural to ask where the Opcache lives in memory. Since PHP supports
// both thread and process-level parallelism, this memory needs to be shared across all PHP
// processes. This means that the Opcache doesn't live in any single processes memory; it's actually
// allocated in shared memory.
//
// The implication of this are:
// a) JIT'd code lives in shared memory, which means that all of the process-local work that the host-agent normally does doesn't really apply for PHP.
// b) The PHP JIT doesn't even live in the same shared object as the PHP interpreter, so we can't
//    find the JIT information from the PHP interpreter.
// c) Even if we could, PHP hides symbols by default and so recovering the relevant information isn't easy in this form[2].
//
// Note that we also can't use the approach used in the V8 interpreter
// because the JIT'd PHP code doesn't ever get loaded as an anonymous mapping (the JIT region is just
// marked as executable and it's never loaded into the executable directly).
// In a sense this is more like how the Hotspot Interpreter works.
//
// The solution for this problem we use here is to resolve the OPcache mapping for the PHP process.
// The reasons for this are:
// a) The OPcache contains symbols for the externally-exposed JIT functions.
// b) At least one of those functions sets a both a pointer to the JIT memory and a variable
//    that contains the size of the buffer.
// c) The OPcache is the shared object that actually allocates the memory: when the OPcache extension
//    is initialized the memory is allocated. This also just makes everything a bit neater.
//
// This means that we can inform the eBPF code that the PHP unwinder should be used whenever JIT'd PHP code is encountered.
//
// The design of this interpreter is therefore as follows: we don't do _any_ PHP unwinding in
// this interpreter at all. This interpreter is solely meant to allow the PHP unwinder to be triggered
// when appropriate. This means that the interpreter is really basic compared to all of the other
// interpreters.
//
// Footnotes:
// (1) In different modes there are other approaches that you can use to do this sort of unwinding. For example, in Debug mode the Zend compiler stores
//     information about each JIT'd frames in a jit_globals structure. This is probably really useful if the client is running in Debug mode (or if they've
//     compiled PHP with HAVE_GDB enabled or similar) but this isn't guaranteed to work across all deployments (whereas this version should).
// (2) The original version (i.e pre-PR) code tried to do this. You can (in theory) walk the module registry that PHP provides to find the JIT info at runtime
//     and then you can do this all inside interpreterphp. However, this turned out to be really complicated, brittle and less efficient than this approach (there were
//     far more memory reads from the particular process during the initial loading than with this approach).
// (3) Note that this code should also work with PHP's thread-safe resource management mechanism. Since the JIT buffer is shared across all processes anyway clients who
//     use the TSRM shouldn't encounter any issues here. There are other uncommon ways to build PHP, but these also shouldn't affect how this code works.
