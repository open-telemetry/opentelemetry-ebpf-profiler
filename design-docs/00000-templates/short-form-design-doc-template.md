Short-Form Design Doc Template
==============================

> [!NOTE]
>
> This template is intended to propose problems and solutions for which a
> fully fledged design document is likely not necessary. A document made from
> this template will have less high level context and detail than a long-form
> document.

# Meta

- **Author(s)**: Name of the author(s)
- **Start Date**: Start date of the design doc
- **Goal End Date**: Intended end date for the design process
- **Primary Reviewers**: A list of at least two primary reviewers

# Problem

Clearly describe the problem.

# Success Criteria

By far the main pitfall in many design docs is not clearly defining what
"success" means. This sometimes can lead the author to meander into
less-important areas, or ignore an important aspect completely. This can
also lead the reviewers to be on a completely different line of thought,
orthogonal to the doc.

This section is more or less what defines the outline and then sets the
stage for the sections/subsections of the document. It's a reality
check that allows the authors and the reviewers to agree on the basis
for the design, and how it should be reviewed. It should help to make
sure everybody is focused on the same thing.

Usually this should be presented as a concise series of bullet points.

## Scope

This expands on the "success criteria", but helps to clear up possible
confusion about what the design doc is about and is not about. It's
usually extremely short, a few bullet points. The most useful info here
is usually "XYZ is not in scope" to avoid ambiguity. This ensures we
don't make incorrect assumptions when reading the doc

# Proposed Solution

A proposed solution for the problem. Even though this is a short-form
design document you must still provide enough information to allow the
reviewers to understand and assess what you are proposing.
